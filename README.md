## Survey Analysis for the UCLA Dashew Center
-[Enhancing OPT and OPT STEM Student Experiences: Analysis of Survey Data (Dashew Center for International Students & Scholars, 2020)]()
This report discussed key insights and recommendations drawn from a 2020 survey of international alumni engaging in Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Optional Practical Training STEM Extension (OPT STEM). The purpose of this report is to provide insight on the resources used and challenges experienced throughout students’ OPT or OPT STEM experience. These insights will help the Dashew Center enhance student experiences as they relate to the OPT and OPT STEM application process. Another purpose for this report is to reveal the status of the Dashew Center’s second departmental outcome: international students and scholars will feel supported, empowered, and confident to make decisions about their visa status, education, engagement opportunities, and career trajectory. This report explores the extent to which this departmental outcome is being realized in the realm of OPT, which speaks to the career trajectory of international student experiences.

The details of this work are confidential. However, I would love to discuss the methods of data analysis utlized in this report. These largely include the use of R, RStudio and Excel, statistical modeling and survey analysis.
